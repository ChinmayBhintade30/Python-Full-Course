 song = c.lower().split(" ")[1]

 you know that 
 c.lower will first make all characters in lower case 

 if the user tells or says play skyfall


then split function will split the words play and skyfall in two different words 
and make a list of it 
['play',"skyfall"] like this and [1] means accessing the first index word of the list

so the 1st index word is skyfall in the list so it will route to the word in the dictionary of the music library file
and it will  get the value of the key which is nothing but the url of the youtube video song



   elif c.lower().startswith("play"):
        song = c.lower().split(" ")[1]
        link = musicLibrary.music[song]


this means that--> if the word starst with play then , the song variable will store the value of split list of index 1 
which will be the name of the song , so 
that name will be open by music library in link variable  , and then link will be open in
