#Loops - 
# Loops in Python are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.


#Two types of loop mainly:-
"""
1. For loop - used when definite number of iteration and number of iteration are know

2. while loop - indefinite number of iteration and runs until the condition is true

"""


print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)

#for loop:-
for i in range(1,6):
    print(i)


#here syntax of for loop 
#i is any iterating random variable

#range () function is used to set the initial and termination limit
#same like list accessing or indexing concept 
#first element will be printed, but the last element will be excluded and last - 1 elements get printed or iterated

#here i printed 1 to 5 (6-1)
