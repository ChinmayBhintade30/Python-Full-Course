#for loops:-

#range function automatically generates the number from the start to stop limit - used to generate the sequence of the numbers

#If we mention single digit  - then , the range function() reads the range as (0,4)


for i in range(4):
    print(i)

# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3

#for loop has start ,stop and step size but - step size not usually used
