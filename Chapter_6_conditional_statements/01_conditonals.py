#In python programming , we must satify or must be able to execute instructions on conditions being met
#In other word when some condition is i true , we execute certai block of code
#Also if there are more than one condition we have different results 
#same for if the conditions are false


#the above space in the if block when if (conditon1): 
#The space  before the print statement is called 'Indentation'

#the statements after the if statement with space are if block statements

#We can come out of the if block by coming out ofthe block


#if else ladder

a = int(input("Enter you age: "))
if(a>18):
    print("you are above the age of consent")

else:
    print("You are below the age of consent")






#This is else block



#if the condition in the if is true then , it executes the if block statments

#and ignore the else statments


#if the 'if' condition is false, then it execeutes th e else statements

# Enter you age: 45
# you are above the age of consent

#There are multiple conditions so ellif is one of the statements used between if and else
