#\t creates a white space of one tab in the string


string2 = "I am good boy as well as a bad \"boy\"" 

print(string2)

# I am good boy as well as a bad "boy"

# \" \" is used to highlight a  word or string by double qoutes as we use qoutes for string in python

#it prints actual double qoutes in the output data



string3 = "I am good boy and a bad 'boy'"
print(string3)
# I am good boy and a bad 'boy'

#we use single qoutes if string is in double qoutes and viceversa
