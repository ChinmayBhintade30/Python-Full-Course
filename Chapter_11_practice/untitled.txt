new salary = old salary * (1+ increment /100)

new salary = old salary + old salary * increment/100

old salary = 10000
new salary = 12000
increment = 20 %

increment = ((new salary / old salary) - 1) * 100

increment = ((12000 / 10000) - 1) * 100

increment = (12/10 - 1) * 100

increment = 2/10 * 100
increment = 20 is the increment (in percentage)



(a+bj)×(c+dj)=(ac−bd)+(ad+bc)j
this is the formula for multiplication for complex numbers
